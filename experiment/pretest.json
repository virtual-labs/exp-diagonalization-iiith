      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The function is one-to-one or injective because $f(x)$ maps distict values of domain to distinct values in co-domain.",
        "b": "The function is not surjective as there are elements in the co-domain that are not mapped to any element of the domain, for example $5$.",
        "c": "The function is not bijective because it is not surjective. Bijective function must be both injective and surjective."
