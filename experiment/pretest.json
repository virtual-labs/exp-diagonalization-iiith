      "question": "Which of these is an infinite set?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "all rational numbers from $ 1 $ to $ 1 $ billion",

        "d": "all of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! Although there are infinitely many rational numbers between any two rationals, the set of rationals in the bounded interval [1, 1 billion] is finite when considering only rational numbers that can be explicitly listed or enumerated within that finite interval.",
        "b": "Correct! Between any two real numbers, there are infinitely many real numbers, making this an infinite set.",
        "c": "Incorrect! This is a finite set as it has an upper bound (2¹⁰) and integers are discrete.",
        "d": "Incorrect! Only the set of real numbers between 5 and 10 is infinite."

      "question": "Consider a function where no two elements of the domain map to the same element in the co-domain and where the size of the domain and the co-domain is the same (for finite sets). Such function is ______.",

        "b": "surjective",
        "c": "bijective",
        "d": "none of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! While the function is injective (one-to-one), it's also surjective since domain and codomain have same size.",
        "b": "Incorrect! While the function is surjective (onto), it's also injective due to the one-to-one mapping.",
        "c": "Correct! For finite sets of equal size with no two elements mapping to the same output, the function must be bijective (both injective and surjective).",
        "d": "Incorrect! The function satisfies properties of both injection and surjection, making it bijective."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! The function cannot be injective as two elements map to the same output.",
        "b": "Incorrect! With same-sized finite sets, if two elements map to same output, some outputs must be unmapped.",
        "c": "Incorrect! Cannot be bijective as it's neither injective nor surjective.",
        "d": "Correct! For finite sets of equal size, if two elements map to the same output, the function is neither injective nor surjective, making it none of these types."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! The function might not be one-to-one, multiple elements could map to same output.",
        "b": "Correct! This is the definition of a surjective (onto) function - every element in codomain has at least one preimage.",
        "c": "Incorrect! While surjective, we don't know if it's injective, so can't be sure it's bijective.",
        "d": "Incorrect! The function is clearly surjective by definition."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The function maps {1,2,3,4} to {4,8,12,16}, with each input giving a unique output.",
        "b": "Incorrect! Many numbers in codomain (like 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,...) are not mapped to by any input.",
        "c": "Incorrect! Cannot be bijective as it's not surjective (many unmapped codomain elements).",

        "d": "There exists a bijection from $ B $ to $ A $"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! A bijection between infinite and finite sets is impossible as they have different cardinalities.",
        "b": "Correct! We can map multiple elements from A to each element in B, creating a surjection. (Additionally, option c is also correct.)",
        "c": "Correct! Since A is infinite and B is finite, we can always find an injection from B to A by mapping each element of B to distinct elements in A. (Additionally, option b is also correct.)",
        "d": "Incorrect! A bijection would require both sets to have the same cardinality."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect! Cantor's method proves some infinite sets are uncountable.",
        "b": "Incorrect! This is exactly what Cantor's method disproves.",
        "c": "Incorrect! The set of finite binary strings is actually countable.",
        "d": "Correct! Cantor's diagonalization proves this set is uncountable by showing no bijection to natural numbers exists."

        "a": "Correct! For finite sets with equal sizes and surjectivity, each element in B must have exactly one preimage by the pigeonhole principle, making f injective.",
        "b": "Incorrect! It must be injective, not just might be (for finite sets).",
        "c": "Incorrect! It actually must be injective due to the pigeonhole principle (for finite sets).",
