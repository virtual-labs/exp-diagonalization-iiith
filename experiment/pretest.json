        "a": "all rational numbers from 1 to 1 billion",
        "b": "all real numbers from 5 to 10",

        "a": "There are infinitely many rational numbers between any two rational numbers",
        "b": "There are infinitely many real numbers between any two real numbers",

      "question": "A function exists where each element of the domain is mapped to one element of the co domain which is of same size. this function is ______",
      "answers": {
        "a": "injective",
        "b": "surjective",

      "question": "A function f(x)=4x has domain that is first 4 natural numbers and co domain that is first 16 natural numbers. the function is ______",
      "answers": {
        "a": "injective",
        "b": "surjective",
        "c": "bijective",
        "d": "answer4"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "the function is one to one or surjective because f(x) only has one value for any possible value of x",
        "b": "the function is not surjective as there are elements in the co domain that aren't mapped to any element of the domain, like 5",
        "c": "the function is not bijective because it isn't surjective. BIjective function must be both injective and surjective."
